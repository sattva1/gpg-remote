""" GPG Remote Client Module

    copyright: 2015, Vlad "SATtva" Miller, http://vladmiller.info
    license: GNU GPL, see COPYING for details.

    This module is intended as a drop-in replacement for unprivileged GnuPG
    executable. Its purpose is to grab command line arguments, parse them
    into an internal format, get STDIN, load files data, and tranfer all
    that as a request package to the GPG Remote Server. The server, in
    turn, filters command line arguments of inaproprite input, calls gpg
    with provided data, and returns output (namely, newly created files,
    STDOUT, STDERR, and exit code) back to the client.

    The client reads configuration data (specifically, server listening
    host:port) from gpgremote_client.conf file located in ~/.gnupg
    directory unless path is overridden with GNUPGHOME environment
    variable.

    See README for additional details.
